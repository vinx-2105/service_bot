===================================
You can use any part of the code for whatever purpose you want

*motioncontrol2 is the newer version for motioncontrol
*motorcontrol uses GPIO zero library whereas motorcontrol2 uses Rpi.GPIO library, I prefer to use motorcontrol2
*sensorcontrol contaions the code to detect the position of bot over the line
*Control class in the motioncontrol module is the main class that controls the motion of the bot using the classes sensor control and motorcontrol
*There is a control function in the class that takes a list of directions as a parameter and goes on the given path.
